# ðŸª‚ Skydiving Weather Dashboard

A **Streamlit** app that visualizes real-time skydiving weather data pulled from **BigQuery**.
disclaimer: it is a really stupid app that is just intended to show my ability to make an end-to-end data engineering project. The focus here isn't on the utility of the app itself, but on demonstrating my skills in cloud infrastructure, data pipelines, orchestration (Airflow), BigQuery integration, API consumption, and frontend visualization with Streamlit.

It's a fun way to showcase my ability to connect multiple technologies into a cohesive, automated pipeline, handle real-time data ingestion, and deploy a fully functioning app â€” all while managing CI/CD, security (secrets management), and cloud services.

If you're here for serious skydiving weather insights... you might want to look elsewhere.
